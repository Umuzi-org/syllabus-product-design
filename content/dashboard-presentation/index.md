Congratulations on successfully putting together your dashboard! Next, weâ€™d like you to present back to us and take us through your process. Presentation time: 7min p.p.

Reflect on the following questions: 
- How might you further refine your dashboard? 
- What surprised you about this process? 
- What other things might you wish to re-design in a process like this?

### Deliverables
- Create a presentation on Google slides or PowerPoint and submit the link before the presentation. 

Good luck!
