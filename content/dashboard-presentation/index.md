### Description
Delivering a compelling dashboard presentation is no easy task. Your job is to help your audience make the best decisions. It's important to be very clear on the purpose of the dashboard. Ask yourself the following questions: 
- Why are you creating this dashboard?
- Do you need to track certain key performance indicators?
- Who needs to see the dashboard?

Remember that your audience have no clue what your dashboard is showing. Tell an appealing story and draw attention to the area you are discussing.

### Task 
You will be required to prepare and present a 10min presentation taking us through your dashboard process. 

### How to do this?
- Decide what your audience needs from your dashboard
- Group related or relevant data together
- Decide on the dashboard colour scheme
- Decide on the data visualisation i.e. pie chart, pivot table etc.

### Deliverables
- Submit a link of your iterated dashboard presentation on your Figma project.
