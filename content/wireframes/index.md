A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product.

Low-fidelity wireframes are basic visual representations of the webpage and usually serve as the designâ€™s starting point. As such, they tend to be fairly rough, created without any sense of scale, grid, or pixel-accuracy. The most commonly used wireframe is the mid-fidelity wireframes feature more accurate representations of the layout. While they still avoid distractions such as images or typography, more detail is assigned to specific components, and features are clearly differentiated from each other.

Elements that are typically found in wireframes include logos, search fields, headers, share buttons, and pseudo-Latin (Lorem Ipsum) placeholder text. High-fidelity wireframes may also include navigation systems, contact information, and footers.

### Task 
Using your user flow diagram as a guide, create mid-fi wireframes displaying a simple skeletal framework of how your user would navigate through an app or website.


### How to do this?
