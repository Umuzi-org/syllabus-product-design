A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Wireframes define the hierarchy of items on a screen and communicate what the items on that page should be based on user needs. Elements that are typically found in wireframes include logos, search fields, headers, share buttons, and pseudo-Latin (Lorem Ipsum) placeholder text.

### Task
