Map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. The problem you choose to solve must be a manageable piece that you can solve in one week. 

### How to do this? 
- Write down a list of questions (7-10) to be used in your interviews and the approach you will follow to ensure that you obtain (and document) as much useful information as possible.
- Interview real people in order to uncover needs that they have, which they may or may not be aware of. 
- To get useful information you need to interview a good, preferably randomised sample of users/people (7-10) and ask good questions.
