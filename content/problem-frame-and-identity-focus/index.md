### Description
In-depth interviews and quantitative research helps us get a better sense of the people we’re designing for. There’s no better way to understand the hopes, desires, and aspirations of those you’re designing for than by talking with them directly. Interviews can be a bit daunting, but when done correctly will help you unlock all kinds of insights and understanding that you’ll never get sitting behind your desk. You can learn so much about a person’s mindset, behaviour, and lifestyle by talking with them where they live or work.

### Task 9: Problem Framing + Identity Focus [Time Estimate: 5 Hours]
You will be required to conduct in-depth interviews and quantitative research to better understand their hopes, desires, and aspirations. In addition, you will map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. The problem you choose to solve must be a manageable piece that you can solve in one week. 

### How to do this? 
- Write down a list of questions (7-10) to be used in your interviews and the approach you will follow to ensure that you obtain (and document) as much useful information as possible.
- Interview real people in order to uncover needs that they have, which they may or may not be aware of. 
- To get useful information you need to interview a good, preferably randomised sample of users/people (7-10).

#### Interpret your findings
Search for meaning in what you just learned. Take a couple of minutes to read over your notes. Write down answers to the following questions:
- What are your findings / trends and patterns?
- What are your top 3 users' needs?
- What is your problem statement? Write it in the following format: As a user, I need [insert desired action] because current [insert insight]. 

### Deliverables
Create a google document with all your research findings. Please submit the link on the project card once completed. Make sure that your document contains the following headings:
- Interview questions. 
- Interview answers as per interviewee.
- Interpretations.
- Problem statement.
