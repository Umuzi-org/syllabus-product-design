title: User Journey Mapping
---

### Description
Now that you’ve learnt a bit about your user, you need to create a user journey visualising their daily commute. A user journey map helps us understand what the day in the life of the user currently looks like. Do this by plotting out a story of the user, thinking through the good moments and the bad ones. We want to see the emotion of the user at each point, as they experience the scenarios they find themselves in. A user journey map should help you to visualise your user’s experience from beginning to end.

### Task 2: User Journey Mapping [Time Estimation: 2.5 Hours]
Capture your user’s daily commute journey. In each frame, capture what they’re thinking, feeling and doing.

### How to do this?
- Use the 9 frames template on Figma. The story you will tell about your user must be 9 frames. If you use too few frames, you won’t get enough information; if you use too many, you’ll have too much information.
- Remember, it’s about the user. You must draw the user in each frame capturing what they’re thinking, feeling and doing. Capture relevant experiences only. Each frame must be a relevant step to the experience we’re empathising with.

### Deliverables
Create a user journey map on Figma. Please submit the link on the project card once completed. Make sure that your user journey map contains the following:
- 9 frames. In each frame capture what your user is thinking, feeling, and doing.
