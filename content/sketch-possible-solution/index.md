### Description
Solution Sketch is a method used to expand upon one solution idea. The goal is to create one fully fleshed out idea for the solution that is thought to be the best. A Solution Sketch should include frames or states of the concept to help illustrate how it works, as well as a clear title to help people remember it.

### Task 10: Sketch Possible Solution [Time Estimate: 5 Hours]

You will be required to focus on sketching possible solutions for your user. Review existing ideas and think of how you can remix and improve them. Sketching possible solutions is something that anyone can do but it doesn’t come naturally. Remember, the solution that you come up with is what you will prototype. 

### How to do this?
- You should have a stack of solutions. But remember, too many solutions are also a problem because you can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. 
- Spend some time critiquing each solution, and decide which one(s) have the best chance of being prototyped and tested. 
- Then, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.

### Deliverables
Create an actionable solution + a step-by-step plan for your prototype on Figma. Please submit the link on the project card once completed.
