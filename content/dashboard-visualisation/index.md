In general, data visualisation is about displaying data points from a dataset or collections of data points in some representation format. The representation format could be points on a map, slices of a pie chart, or a line along data points over some time period. 

### Task
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions. 

Nuri’s Coffee Shop is a popular coffee shop in the heart of Main Street, Johannesburg. Nuri - the owner of the coffee shop - needs your help in visualising some data sets using appropriate data visualisations tools. To gauge customer satisfaction, you have completed quantitative research over a period of two months. You looked at sales by drink type, sales by week, important attributes when consuming coffee and average daily sales by drink type: Month 1 vs. Month 2. 

Now that you have the full quantitative results, you’re preparing a dashboard presentation to communicate key insights with Nuri and her team. Since the feedback is a direct response to Nuri’s Coffee Shop efforts, you want to make sure they understand what the results mean.

The quantitative research uncovered four interesting data points that you want to bring to Nuri and her team:

#### Data Sets to Visualise

###### Sales by Drink Type
- Regular Drip – 20 cups per day
- Espresso – 10 cups per day
- Cappuccino – 15 cups per day
- Cafe Latte – 6 cups per day
- Macchiato – 8 cups per day

###### Sales by Week
- W1 - R25000
- W2 - R20600
- W3 - R11500
- W4 - R35000

###### Important attributes when consuming coffee
- 50% - Speed of services
- 20% - Sales promotion
- 5% - Enjoyable atmosphere
- 10% - Quality of coffee beans
- 5% - Price
- 10% - Friendly services

###### Average Daily Sales by Drink Type Month 1 vs. Month 2
Month 1:
- Regular Drip – 20 cups per day
- Espresso – 17 cups per day
- Cappuccino – 15 cups per day
- Cafe Latte – 25 cups per day
- Macchiato – 10 cups per day

Month 2:
- Regular Drip – 25 cups per day
- Decaf Drip – 15 cups per day
- Cappuccino – 20 cups per day
- Cafe Latte - 11 cups per day
- Macchiato – 13 cups per day

### How to do this?
**Step 1**: Write a title and short (literally, just short!) description of the quantitative data.

**Step 2**: Visualise the data in the form of a dashboard. Think about what kind of information the data point provides. Then consider what type of chart or graph conveys those findings most clearly. You can select, appropriately, from the following visualisations:
- **Bar or column chart**: Best for comparing two or more values
- **Pie chart**: Best for demonstrating composition
- **Line graph**: Best for analyzing trends and behaviors over time
- Any other visualisation which best suits the data

**Step 3**: Determine what key takeaways you draw from the dashboard. Consider what the chart or graphs communicate about the data.
