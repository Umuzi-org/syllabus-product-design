### Description

User flow or UX flow is a visual representation of a specific route that a user might take through a website or app in order to achieve a goal. The route starts at a specific point of entry and covers all the steps the user must take to reach a certain outcome. There is often more than one route a user could follow to complete the task. When thinking about user flows, it’s important to consider all the ways users could potentially navigate through your site or app so that you can identify key pathways (generally those that are the most simple and direct).

### Task

Design a user flow diagram for your user navigating through an app or website to enhance their commute experience. Think through what you discovered with their unique aspects and needs of their daily commute in your user journey map. Tip: do some research on commute apps to get ideas on how you could design your user flow diagram.

### How to do this?

- Figure out the objective of the user flow is. Example, the goal of the user flow is for a user to download a video.
- Record your user flows in a simple bullet-point list first.
- Map out the user flow from the user’s perspective. Take into consideration your user’s pain points, level of expertise, and preferences.

### Deliverables

- Create a simple user flow diagram on Figma. Once completed, submit a link to your Figma project.
