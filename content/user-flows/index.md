### Description
User flow or UX flow is a visual representation of a specific route that a user might take through a website or app in order to achieve a goal. The route starts at a specific point of entry and covers all the steps the user must take to reach a certain outcome. There is often more than one route a user could follow to complete the task. When thinking about user flows, itâ€™s important to consider all the ways users could potentially navigate through your site or app so that you can identify key pathways (generally those that are the most simple and direct).

### Task 3: User Flow Diagram [Time Estimation: 2.5 Hours]
Design a user flow diagram for your user navigating through an app or website to enhance their commute experience. Think through what you discovered with their unique aspects and needs of their daily commute in your user journey map. Tip: do some research on commute apps to get ideas on how you could design your user flow diagram.  

### How to do this? 
- Figure out the goal of the user flow is. For example, the goal of the user flow is for a user to download a video. Tip: include an action word / verb in your objective. With the example above, the action word is download.
- Record your user flows in a simple bullet-point list first.
- Map out the user flow steps to completion from entry / start point to the final interaction. 

### Deliverables
Create a user flow diagram on Figma. Please submit the link on the project card once completed. Make sure that your user flow diagram contains the following:
- Goal of the user flow - this should be a concise sentence.
- Bullet-point list.
- User flow diagram with a clear entry / start point to the final interaction.
