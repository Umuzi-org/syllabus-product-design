# Challenge: Improve working professionals' experiences of working remotely

### The Brief

**Context** 
The Covid 19 pandemic has impacted many lives and economies around the world. Measures were put in place to slow down the spread of the virus including businesses and various organisations encouraging working professionals to work from home. Working from home may seem like a dream come true for many but has its own set of challenges including “unplugging from work”, working in non-remote spaces, and distractions from home. These are just a few of many.   

#### Challenge
Identify a challenge working professionals face working from home and come up with a solution to improve their experience.
