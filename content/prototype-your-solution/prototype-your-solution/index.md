After coming up with an actionable plan and creating a storyboard for your prototype, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with users. Prototyping is getting ideas and explorations out of your head and into the physical world. A prototype can be anything that takes a physical (or digital) form that a user can interact with. **Note:** This step can become a bottleneck between dream and reality, but often the simple prototype is the most effective  -  don’t worry about it being fully operational, lead with a basic mock-up or rendering.

### How to do this?
Build! Start building your prototype based on a very basic plan. Get started even if you feel that you don’t know what you’re doing; doing something can spark creativity. 

### Identify Variables: 
Identify which variable(s) of your problem the prototype is meant to test with each iteration.

### Build with your User in mind: 
Ask yourself what you’re trying to test with the user and what you expect to observe when they interact with your prototype. Tip: Use information uncovered in the define step. 

**NB:** A prototype should produce useful and actionable feedback. 

### Expected outcomes:
A well thought out prototype that will test specific variables about the problem. Make sure everything is ready for testing by confirming the schedule with your user, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script.
