### Description

After coming up with an actionable plan and creating a storyboard for your prototype, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with users. Prototyping is getting ideas and explorations out of your head and into the physical world. A prototype can be anything that takes a physical (or digital) form that a user can interact with. **Note:** this step can become a bottleneck between dream and reality, but often the simple prototype is the most effective  -  don’t worry about it being fully operational, lead with a basic mock-up or rendering.

### Task

You will be required create a well thought out prototype on Figma that will test specific variables about the problem you've identified.

### How to do this?

- Build! Start building your prototype based on a very basic plan. Get started even if you feel that you don’t know what you’re doing; doing something can spark creativity.
- Identify Variables. Identify which variable(s) of your problem the prototype is meant to test with each iteration.
- Build with your user in mind. Ask yourself what you’re trying to test with the user and what you expect to observe when they interact with your prototype.
  **NB:** A prototype should produce useful and actionable feedback.

### Deliverables:

- Create a digital prototype on Figma. Once completed, submit a link to your Figma file.
