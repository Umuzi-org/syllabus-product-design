Your bootcamp experience started off with a big challenge, and not much else. So far, you’ve framed your problem statement, created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But you’ll take it one step further as you interview users and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire challenge worthwhile: at the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next.

### How to do this?
Observe how users interact with your prototype. What you’re trying to see is whether your proposed solution works. What you find determines whether you need to move forward or go back to one of the previous steps.

### Show Don’t Tell:
Create a space for the user to interact with your prototype. Watch how they use (and misuse!) what you have given them, and how they handle and interact with it; then listen to what they say about it, and the questions they have.

### Create Experiences:
Create your prototypes and test them in a way that feels like an experience that your user is reacting to, rather than an explanation that your user is evaluating.

### Watch and Listen:
Ask users to go through the process as you observe. Encourage them to describe as much as possible what they are doing and the reasons for doing it.

### Expected outcomes: 
- Document your test results on Figma and submit a link to your file.
