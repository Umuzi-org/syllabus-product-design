Congratulations on successfully building your prototype and putting it to the test! Next, weâ€™d like you to present back to us and take us through your process.

Reflect on the following questions: 
- What feedback did you get, and how might you further refine your idea? 
- What surprised you about this process? 
- What other things might you wish to re-design in a process like this?

## Presentation time: 
- 10min p.p.
