Welcome to the UX Strategy bootcamp! You're officially one step closer to landing your learnership spot. The UX Strategy bootcamp is an intense two week sprint that'll separate the strongest from the not so strong (hopefully for this round). You'll engage directly with the manager on mini design challenges and a design brief. You will be assessed on your conceptual, technical and professional skills - so bring your A-game! At the end of the two weeks, we'll make our final selection decision.
